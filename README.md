# LangChain-PDF-Assistant with Streamlit

## Description
This project allows you to upload a PDF file and ask questions about its content. The system extracts text from the PDF, splits it into manageable chunks, and uses LangChain to provide answers to your questions. It utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model for answering the questions and Streamlit for building the web application.
